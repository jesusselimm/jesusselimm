        <li>My interest in music, architecture and visual arts has given me a natural sensitivity to typography choice, color palette harmony and user experience. In this way, I care about creating interfaces that not only work, but also feel and guide. For me, design is an invisible journey that leads the user consciously and intuitively to a goal.</li>
