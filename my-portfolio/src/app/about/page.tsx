        <li>I reinforced what I learned by developing my own portfolio site and various projects. I started to deepen in UI/UX and QA. I started to see design not only as "visual" but also as "meaningful experience".</li>

        <li>In my software journey, I realized that especially the front-end side is closer to me. I realized that the user interface development process is not just about writing code; it is also the art of balancing design and aesthetics.</li>
        <li>My interest in music, architecture and visual arts has given me a natural sensitivity to typography choice, color palette harmony and user experience. In this way, I care about creating interfaces that not only work, but also feel and guide. For me, design is an invisible journey that leads the user consciously and intuitively to a goal.</li>
